# FNF-MIDIs
Here are some FNF MIDIs I make and will use for covers later on!
Be aware that if you use the MIDIs you have to credit me!
All of these are made on mobile because I don't have a PC yet, but I'm gonna be getting one on christmas so I'll try to improve when I get it!
I will be posting some vocals here as well. (Note that I won't be making MIDIs sound the same way as Blantados' MIDIs, the vocals won't be timed perfectly with the instrument so ne aware of that)
